This project shows a 3D visualization of a 4x4x4 cube made
of colored spheres.

## Features

- 64 spheres arranged in a 4x4x4 cube
- Color gradient across the spheres
- Interactive camera controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Gentle rotation animation
- Starry background

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript ES modules
- HTML5 and CSS

## Limitations

- Currently, all the code needs to live in a single source
  file, since relative imports are not yet supported in the
  VizHub Runtime
