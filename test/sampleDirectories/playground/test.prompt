# Test Prompt File

This is a test `.prompt` file to verify that it:
- Gets Markdown syntax highlighting
- Shows the Markdown icon in the file tree
- Has line wrapping enabled

## Features

* **Bold text**
* *Italic text*
* `Code blocks`

```javascript
// Code blocks should be highlighted
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

## Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

This file should be treated exactly like a `.md` file in the CodeMirror editor.
